latexdemo
=========
Demonstrate LaTeX code with its resulting output.

== Description ==

This package provides configurable tools to print out LaTeX code and
the resulting output in the same document. It supports to print out
the result inside a conditional sequence. This allows to print the
result only if it would compile, which can be done with code such
as:

\begin{DefineCode}
\so{letterspacing}
\end{DefineCode}

\ifcsdef{so}{%
Commands of package \package{soul}:
\PrintDemo{style=parallel}%
}{}%

This package is comprehensively used in the documentation of the 
LaTeX Thesis template: https://code.google.com/p/latexthesistemplate/
