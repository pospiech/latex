	sustained self-pulsing (SSP) in a unidirectional ring-fiber laser
	using only the interaction between the saturated population inversion
	and the optical signal circulating in the laser cavity. Gain saturation
	alone is used to explain SML behavior close to laser threshold and
	the sharp transition to an SSP regime. The model also describes self-pulsing
	inhibition to the profit of SML for a sufficiently high pump power.
	Experimental results agree with most model predictions, but the overestimation
	of the self-pulsing threshold suggests that the phenomenon is furthered
	by an effect other than gain saturation.},

  abstract = {We conducted a detailed study of the stability of short, erbium-doped
	fiber lasers fabricated with two UV-induced Bragg gratings written
	into the doped fiber. We find that the relative intensity noise of
	single-longitudinal-mode fiber grating lasers is approximately 3
	orders of magnitude lower than that of a single-frequency 1.523-
	m helium-neon laser. The frequency noise spectrum contains few resonances,
	none of which exceeds 0.6 kHz Hz 1 2 rms; the integrated rms frequency
	noise from 50 Hz to 63 kHz is 36 kHz. We also demonstrate a simple
	method for monitoring the laser power and number of oscillating modes
	during laser fabrication.},
